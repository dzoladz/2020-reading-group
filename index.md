# Design After the End of the World
## Speculative Design and Climate Reading Group

#### INSTRUCTORS: Renee Albrecht-Mallinger and John Jung

Where traditional design attempts to <strong>solve</strong> problems, speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being, to construct spaces for discussion, and to inspire imagination. <strong><em>Design After the End of the World: Speculative Design and Climate</em></strong>, a reading group hosted by Renee Albrecht-Mallinger and John Jung, will explore the pressing issue of climate change through the lens of speculative design. Readings will explore both climate and design from a variety of perspectives, whether creative, philosophical or personal. Participants will be encouraged to push their thinking on both climate and design forward through group discussions and design activities. The course will also be a chance to look at design from a critical perspective and to see if it might be useful to begin to confront a truly massive, “wicked” problem.
